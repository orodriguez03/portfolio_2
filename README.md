# Second Round Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This website is done using GitHub. I enjoyed coding the sustainability map so I wanted to continue doing web development. These exercises allowed me to showcase my technical, attention to detail, and problem solving skills. Below is project 1, the crowdbuilding project, and more.

# [Project 1: Sustainability Map](http://sustainabilitymap.hamline.edu/)
The sustainability map is a resource where one access sustainable on and off campus locations. In "Let This Radicalize You", the idea of creating space and freedom is expressed. "According to Gilmore, by doing this liberatory work of making place, we can "share that freedom by sharing space that every embodied consciousness who joins together in that struglle os then joining together" (82)

### API Key
To update the map, a API key was added. The website was because made in 2017, before websites like this needed a Google API key. Originally the website was greyed out and had "For Developers Use Only". Once I had access to the webstie through Google cloud console, I went to obtained a Google maps API key. From there I downloaded the html file and opened it up in the application, Brackets. From there I scrolled towards the bottom to find the script src line.

### Food Resource Center
Now I transitioned away from Brackets and downloaded Visual Studio Code. VSCode is where I was able to edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file. The first three location that I added were off campus parks. And the last location I added was the Food Resource Center. I wanted to highlight the FRC because It used Nasrudin's report. The HTML file was used to add in the text and images. The CSS file allowed me to re size and format the pictures provided to me. And the JavaScript code is where I spent most of the time in. Here I added in the pin point marker, next and previous buttons, and the hover label. To achieve this I reference the code that was used for the other locations. Below is the html lines of the FRC.

### Google Form and Slight Website Updates
To involve the community I created a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScY8s0uGz68mCuiPU6TVUTl2Tzr64m2JJhRn298NZqpELA0ng/viewform), where one could add a location. I added this form to the website, as well. Aside from updated the "about the map" section. I included that this map recently went through updates.
