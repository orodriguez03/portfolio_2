# Second Round Portfolio 
Welcome to my portfolio! This website is done using GitHub. I found working on the sustainability map very fun for me so I wanted to continue doing web development. These exercises allowed me to showcase my technical, attention to detail, and problem solving skills. Aside form that, I'm currently applying for internships and jobs right now so I started to showcase my code on GitHub for employers to see. Below is my project 1, crowdbuilding project, and more.
