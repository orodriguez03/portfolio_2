Welcome to my portfolio! This website is done using GitHub. I found working on the sustainability map very fun for me so I wanted to continue doing web development. These exercises allowed me to showcase my technical, attention to detail, and problem solving skills. Aside form that, I'm currently applying for internships and jobs right now so I started to showcase my code on GitHub for employers to see. Below is project 1, the crowdbuilding project, and more.

# [Project 1: Sustainability Map]
The sustainability map is a resource where one access sustainable on campus and off campus locations. 

* Our first task was to revive the map. This was done by adding a API key.
* The HTML, CSS, and java file was edited in Visual Studio Code.


# [Crowdbuilding Project: Landscaping on Campus]
A Canva visual for the Landscaping on Campus presentation. This is a graphic intended to promote a future meeting. It was made to gather and spread information about our ideas.
