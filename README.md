Welcome to my portfolio! This website is done using GitHub. I loved working on the sustainability so I wanted to continue doing web development. These exercises allowed me to showcase my technical, attention to detail, and problem solving skills. Aside from that, I'm currently applying for internships and jobs right now so I started to showcase my code on GitHub for employers to see. Below is project 1, the crowdbuilding project, and more.

# [Project 1: Sustainability Map](http://sustainabilitymap.hamline.edu/)
The sustainability map is a resource where one access sustainable on and off campus locations. 

## API Key
To update the map, a API key was added. The website was because made in 2017, before websites like this needed a Google API key. Originally the website was greyed out and had "For Developers Use Only". Once I had access to the webstie through Google cloud console, I went to obtained a Google maps API key. From there I downloaded the html file and opened it up in the application, Brackets. From there I scrolled towards the bottom to find the script src line. Below, is the line of code with the API key.
